# Coffee Shop POS
 #### This project is inspired from one of the coding assessmnt that I was given while I was applying for internships/ placements and the GUI and the UX are inspired from my part-time job(Coffee Shop). This project implements the Object Oriented Design principles and MVC design architecture pattern to implement the simple logics of Point of Sales for a coffee shop.

> This is a simple implementation of MVC architecture pattern in Java and JavaFX library, and yet it is packed with complex business logics (The order details you see in the screen inside double quote is actually a string value which I have parsed and calculated the values of the ordered drinks and cakes along with add-ons to generate the final order receipt dialog. So, this project focuses more in problem related with string manupulation and so on) and Object Oriented Design principles under the hood so feel free to explore the src code and enjoy!
